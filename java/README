1. Deploy and Run the Server

if you want to deploy the Server, you just modify the IP in the script (deploy.sh), and run it:

    ./deploy.sh



2. Get the Client

if you want to get the Client, you just run:
    
    mvn -U clean package 

and then copy the jar in the subproject opencloud-client/target:
   
    opencloud-client.jar: without the dependency classes;
    opencloud-client-jar-with-dependency.jar: with the dependency classes;
